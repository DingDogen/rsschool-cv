 ### About me
 I am student of Belarusian National Technical University.
 In university I got basic knowledges about C++, Python, Assembler, C#, Computer Sciense and Software development technology.
 My current goal is learn JavaScript + HTML + CSS because I want to become Front-End Developer.  
 As a person I am quite calm and diligent but I don't like super-big difficulties.
